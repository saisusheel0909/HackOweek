# Travel Planner - Academic Project Documentation

## 📋 Project Description

The **Travel Planner** is a web-based application designed to help users plan their trips by providing estimated costs and comprehensive destination information. This offline application uses hardcoded data to calculate trip expenses based on user-selected destinations and duration, making it perfect for budget-conscious travelers who want to plan their trips in advance.

The system provides:
- **Budget Estimation**: Calculates total trip cost including travel, accommodation, food, and local transport
- **Day-wise Itinerary**: Suggests activities for each day of the trip
- **Tourist Information**: Lists famous places to visit at the destination
- **Season Recommendations**: Advises the best time to visit for optimal experience

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Planning a trip involves multiple considerations including budget estimation, itinerary planning, and understanding the best time to visit a destination. Many travelers, especially students and budget-conscious individuals, struggle to:

1. **Estimate accurate trip costs** before booking
2. **Plan day-wise activities** efficiently
3. **Identify must-visit tourist places** at a destination
4. **Determine the best season** for travel

**Current challenges:**
- Scattered information across multiple websites
- Difficulty in budget estimation without real-time data
- Lack of simple, offline tools for trip planning
- Complex interfaces that overwhelm beginner users

**Proposed Solution:**
A simple, offline web application that consolidates all essential travel planning information in one place, providing quick budget estimates and comprehensive destination details without requiring internet connectivity or external APIs.
